## Responsive Design

The Techium website has been designed with responsiveness in mind to ensure a seamless experience on various devices and screen sizes. Here's how we handle responsive design:

### Media Queries

We use media queries in our CSS to adapt the layout and styling based on different screen sizes. For example:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens smaller than 768px */
}

@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
  /* Styles for screens between 769px and 1200px */
}

/* Add more media queries as needed */
```

### Breakpoints

Our project follows these breakpoints for responsive design:

- Small screens: Up to 768px wide
- Medium screens: 769px to 1200px wide
- Large screens: 1201px and above

### CSS Framework

We have used Bootstrap to assist with responsive design components and layout.

### Testing

We have thoroughly tested our project on various devices and browsers to ensure it performs well and looks good across different platforms.
